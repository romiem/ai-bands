List of AI generated bands
========================
This repo contains a [list of AI generated bands](ai-bands.conf) often found on Spotify, Youtube, Apple Music etc.

I cannot guarantee all of these can still be considered AI but we do basic checking so chances are they were producing AI generated music at one point in time.

Contributing
============
Feel free to create a pull request (PR) with additions or request removal of entries (with reasons). Or just send me a direct message on X or Reddit.

**Specifically, please cite in your message why you suspect the band is AI generated along with links to the bands Spotify/Apple Music/Youtube page and additional social media accounts.**

Please add new bands directly into [ai-bands.conf](ai-bands.conf) in the same format and in alphabetical order.
